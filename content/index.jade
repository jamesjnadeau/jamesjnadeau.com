            | Hi,
            br
            br
            | Thanks for coming! My name is James, and I live in 
            a(href='https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Vergennes,+VT') Vermont. 
            | A long time ago, I attended 
            a(href='http://www.rpi.edu/', rel='nofollow') RPI 
            |  and received degrees in Computer Science and Systems Engineering. I've been up to a  
            a(href='/projects/') lot
            |  since then.
            | Through the use of systems I've created, I've helped thousands of businesses, big and small, create happy customers and grow. How can I help you?

            | I am an open source loving, full stack developer and system designer. 
            | I've designed, architected, and built applications for both desktop and mobile. 
            | Ranging from video trancoding for the automobile footage industry, business and content management systems for the non-profit to the fashion industry,
            | and even website systems for plumbers. My varied experince is an asset that brings helpful insights to tough situations.
            | I can help you tackle your technical problems, because I probably have before.
          .frontp
            | I excel at cleaning up other peoples messes, and hitting deadlines.
            | Third party security tests have been unable to get past the security 
            | practices I use, time and time again. If you need it on time, scalable, and secure, I can come 
            | through for you.

              | I love Vermont, and am proud to call this state my home. 
              | I enjoy football, not for the names, but for the strategy and teamwork 
              | required to win. I am currently a high school football referee in Vermont. 
              | The pay isn't great, but it's a great excuse to drive around VT in the 
              | fall and watch some football.

              | Sailing is also one of my hobbies.

                | I own a small sunfish sailboat, but
                | am hoping to upgrade soon to something with a cabin.
              |  I now own a Pearsons 23K, and I've been loving it! Lake champlain is 
              | a hop, skip and a jump away, and all that it has to explore has never let me down.

              | The product of a ski bum mother, I enjoy hitting the slopes in the winter
              | when the weather allows. Admittedly, I'm a little spoiled from my upbringing
              | and haven't gone much in the past couple of years.

              | I've owned a computer since the ripe age of 4. A Macintosh SE as a matter
              | of fact. My mother was/is a graphic artist, and it was bought for her.
              | I think we can both agree I got more out of it. I didn't really discover
              | linux until I was about 15 and began throwing it on every old piece of hardware I could muster.
            .frontp
              | I met the love of my life online and married Sally in June 2015. We hope to buy a home in 2016 and finally have room to have a dog!

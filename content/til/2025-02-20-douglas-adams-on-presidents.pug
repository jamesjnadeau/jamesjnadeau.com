h2 Douglas Adams on presidents

p 
  | "The major problem, one of the major problems, for there are several, with governing people is that of who you get to do it. 
  br
  br
  | Or, rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. 
  br
  br
  | To summarize: 
  br
  | it is a well known and much lamented fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. 
  br
  br
  | To summarize the summary: 
  br
  | anyone who is capable of getting themselves made president should on no account be allowed to do the job. 
  br
  br
  | To summarize the summary of the summary: 
  br
  | people are a problem."

[Do Algorithms Beat Us at Complex Decision Making?](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/03/algorithms-complex-decision-making/)

Short Answer: Yes, and in a lot of cases, better than experts.

Turns out biases get the better of us all, and sticking to simple hueristics gives good results because of consistant input/output and the focus on what's important

Take aways:

* > The surprising success of equal-weighting schemes has an important practical implication: it is possible to develop useful algorithms without prior statistical research. Simple equally weight formulas based on existing statistics or on common sense are often very good predictors of significant outcomes

* >  If you are serious about hiring the best possible person for the job, this is what you should do. First, select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in this position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, and so on). Don't overdo it — six dimensions is a good number. The traits you choose should be as independent as possible from each other, and you should feel that you can assess them reliably by asking a few factual questions. Next, make a list of questions for each trait and think about how you will score it, say on a 1-5 scale. You should have an idea of what you will call “very weak” or “very strong.”
These preparations should take you half an hour or so, a small investment that can make a significant difference in the quality of the people you hire.

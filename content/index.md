				<div class="frontp" >I am from <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Plymouth,+VT" >Plymouth, VT</a> and graduated from <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/" rel="nofollow" >RPI</a>
				with a degree in Computer Science and Systems Engineering. Currently, 
				I specialize in creating advanced information systems.</div>
				
				<div class="frontp" >Having created, upgraded, secured and maintained complex I.T. systems
				for large, <a href="/projects/" >multinational organizations</a>, I am a full stack developer, open source guru, and system designer.
				I can help you tackle your technical problems.</div>
				
				<div class="frontp" >I excel at cleaning up other peoples messes, and hitting deadlines. 
				Third party security tests have been unable to get past the security
				infrastructure I use, time and time again. If you need it on time, scalable, and secure, I can come
				through for you.</div>

					<div class="frontp" >I love Vermont, and am proud to call this state my home. 
					I enjoy football, not for the names, but for the strategy and teamwork 
					required to win. I am currently a high school football referee in Vermont. 
					The pay isn't great, but it's a great excuse to drive around VT in the 
					fall and watch some football. </div>
					
					<div class="frontp" >Sailing is also one of my hobbies. <del>I own a small sunfish sailboat, but 
					am hoping to upgrade soon to something with a cabin.</del> I now own a Pearsons 23K, and I've been loving it! Lake champlain is 
					a hop, skip and a jump away, and all that it has to explore has never let me down. </div>
					
					<div class="frontp" >The product of a ski bum mother, I enjoy hitting the slopes in the winter 
					when the weather allows. Admittedly, I'm a little spoiled from my upbringing
					and haven't gone much in the past couple of years. </div>
					
					<div class="frontp" >I've owned a computer since the ripe age of 4. A Macintosh SE as a matter 
					of fact. My mother was/is a graphic artist, and it was bought for her. 
					I think we can both agree I got more out of it. I didn't really discover 
					linux until I was about 15 and began throwing it on every old piece of hardware I could muster. </div>

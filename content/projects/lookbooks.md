My first client for Clevertech was Lookbooks. I was brought to help them launch version 2 of their product.


I spearheaded their jQuery update, bringing them from 1.4 to 1.10, clearing a 
large amount of blockers for the project moving forward. 


I also implemented or improved many front-end 
interfaces such as:


*  Drag and drop asset management
*  Context menus
*  Inline editing
*  Dashboards
*  Replaced thier flash uploader with a html5 drag and drop upload
*  Integrated with aviary


On the backend I contributed:


*  Worked with existing Sphinx based search provider, to improve it's usage and coverage
*  Allowed wildcard cookies so users could switch between sub-domains, and ultimately versions, of the software
*  Found and fixed SQLi and ffmpeg vulnerabilities
*  Various utility functions for custom data

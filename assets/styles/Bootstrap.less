 * The contents of this file were originally from bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less
 * They have been modified below to redirect to bootstraps implementaion in all cases needed.

 * NOTE Because of the way webpack is currently set up to load less/css and then compile it
 * any less compilation must be included in one less "run"
 * aka the less code is compiled to css immediately, using any variable or
 * code defiend below, will not be available in another file that does not stem from this file

 * NOTE variables.less is imported locally to allow overriding bootstraps variables.
 * you can't make use of this files variables and settings via another require() in index.js
 * use custom.less instead

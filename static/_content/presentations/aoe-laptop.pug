    p.substep üòï I have never been issued a laptop without admin access
    p.substep üó£ Was open about actions and intent from the start

  .step(data-rel-x=space)
    h1 What I Knew
    p.substep ü§ì Previously, I installed software division wide    
    p.substep üöå Peers have admin access already
    p.substep üï¥ Told by ADS staff member I should have admin rights to machine.
    p.substep üßë‚Äçüíº Informed manager that I could work around current missing admin rights easily. ADS staff also heard this.

    h2 What's my official duty?
    p Install Software I need to do my job, Visual Studio, Python, etc
    p Use a computer system which I exclusively have been issued for my own work purposes
    p My efforts only affected my machine & only the exact permission I needed
    p System was brand new and contains no private information other than my own.
    p I was hired because of my technical expertise with software systems.
  .step(data-rel-x=space)
    h1 Actions I performed
    p Copied a file(NTUSER.DAT to NTUSER.MAN)
    p .MAN stands for mandatory settings
    p.small "NTuser.man is the same thing as NTuser.dat, but it has been manually renamed to .man in order to change the profile"
    .substep
      p Altered the file:
        ul
          li Using a supported Windows program for editing settings
          li Turned off only what was blocking me from installing software (UAC)
    p.substep File is supported by Windows, meant for mandatory settings for a local machine.
    p.substep Also ran a security Scan to test if laptop was secured properly
  .step(data-rel-x=space)
    h1 Equivalent Story
    p.substep A mover is asked to head to an address and move some furniture inside a house.
    p.substep The key to get in is not where they were told it would be.
    p.substep Owner was consulted and confirms they can go inside
    p.substep Looking at the building, the front window is open and they can easily get in.
    p.substep Suddenly they notice an alarm goes off. 
    p.substep Wait for Security to come and explain what happened.
  .step(data-rel-x=space)
    h1 What?
    p What party has been damaged or penelized by my actions?
    p What is the cost benefit analysis of ADS's actions to date?
  
  .step(data-rel-x=space)
    h1 Why?
    p Why didn't ADS talk to me about intent?
    p Why didn't they ask if I should have these permissions?
    p Why has no information been sent to me with updates on this situation?
    p Why is it assumed guilty when every action I've been open and upfront about.

  | The best advice I ever got on how to trust my gut and intuition was given to me by a psychotherapist years ago. 
  | She suggested whenever I have a gut instinct — good or bad — I should first rate the intensity of my emotions from 1 to 10. 
  | If they are on the lower end of the spectrum, I’m more inclined to trust my gut. 
  | Emotions — like anger, fear or insecurity — are different from Feelings, because they are usually in reaction to something external and feel like a laser that you want to point at people or things. 
  | Feelings — like profound sadness and love — are more of a state of being, and Intuition is an inner knowing. So whenever I have to distinguish one from the other, I first start by rating my emotions. — Claudia Dawson

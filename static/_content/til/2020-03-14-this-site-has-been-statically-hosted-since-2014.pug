h1 Statically Generated Since 2014

p I've been hosting my site now on a statically generated site since 2014, and it's been a fantastic journey.
  |  I'm on my thrid platform that generates the site.
  |  The amount of choice and flexibility offered by just using flat files is hard to beat.
  |  I imagine I'd still be stuck on whatever DB driving app I had choosen, those migrations are hard to wrap your head around.

    h4 Previous to 2014 - Drupal & jQuery UI
    p I had used Drupal as a CMS for clients for a long time and it became out  of date quickly.

    p  I decided a redesign was in order. I switched to Bootstrap 3(4 was just an idea at this time) and went on the hunt for something that could be hosted as a static site for almost nothing.

          | My first commit 
        |  to the repository was my first draft of my site. 
        | I was writing php solutions for the HVAC industry in PHP at the time and was very comfortable with it. PHP 5 was the latest and greatest at the time.
    p I created a php script to export my nodes from drupal, but ultimately didn't use much of the content from before.
